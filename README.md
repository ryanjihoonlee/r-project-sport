# Determing the Most Challenging Sport

## Overview
This project aims to analyze various sports to identify which one requires the highest level of skill across multiple dimensions. By utilizing data visualization and statistical analysis, the project provides insights into the physical and mental demands of different sports, helping to quantify and compare their difficulty levels.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the difficulty levels of various sports using statistical methods and data visualization techniques. This involves analyzing metrics such as physical demands, skill requirements, and overall performance to determine which sports are the most challenging. 

## Tool

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about various sports and the skills required to excel in them. It encompasses metrics such as endurance, strength, power, speed, agility, flexibility, nerve, durability, hand-eye coordination, and analytical aptitude. Additionally, the dataset provides a total score, which aggregates these individual skill levels, and a rank, which orders the sports based on their total scores. This comprehensive dataset offers a thorough view of the physical and mental demands of different sports.
